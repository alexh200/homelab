## Overview

This homelab is designed as a learning and experimentation platform for:

* Testing **virtualization and containerization** platforms
* Building a secure **networking environment** with VLANs and firewalls
* Deploying and managing **self-hosted services**
* Exploring **monitoring, alerting, and backup** strategies
